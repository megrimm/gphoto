USAGE:

Put the binary in your extra folder.
Put the helpfile in your 5.reference folder.

ISSUES:

libgphoto conflicts with imageMagick. If you are using gphoto with PDP or 
Gem make sure you have compiled without imageMagick.

TODO:

Need to add a function that allows the user to query the details of params.
Currently the gphoto2 command line tool must be use to find out proper param
ranges and values.
